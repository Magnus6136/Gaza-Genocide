## üö® Live Crisis Overview

**This is not a historical document. This is a live feed of human suffering happening in real-time.**

The Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people, is experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. What began as a military operation has escalated into what international organizations are calling a **genocide in progress**. 

### **The Reality Right Now:**
- **Every 10 minutes**, a child dies from violence or starvation
- **Every hour**, entire families are wiped out
- **Every day**, hospitals are bombed while treating patients
- **Every week**, thousands more are displaced and left homeless

> ** These are not just numbers. These are human beings - children, mothers, fathers, grandparents - whose lives are being systematically destroyed.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Setup

### **Live Update System**

This documentation updates **automatically every hour** with the latest verified statistics:

```yaml
name: Update Gaza Statistics

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

# Add permissions to allow the workflow to write to the repository
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install requests beautifulsoup4
        
    - name: Fetch latest statistics
      run: |
        python fetch_statistics.py
        
    - name: Update README badges
      run: |
        python scripts/update_badges.py
        
    - name: Commit and push changes
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
        git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
        git add .
        git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || (git commit -m "Update Gaza statistics - $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC')" && git push)
        
    - name: Create release if major update
      if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
      run: |
        # Create a release if manually triggered
        echo "Manual update completed"
```

## **Alternative Solution: Use Personal Access Token**

If the above doesn't work, you can also create a Personal Access Token:

### **Step 1: Create Personal Access Token**
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Gaza Stats Update"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Copy the token

### **Step 2: Add Token to Repository Secrets**
1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `PAT_TOKEN`
4. Value: Paste your personal access token

### **Step 3: Update Workflow to Use Token**
```yaml
name: Update Gaza Statistics

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual trigger
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
        
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install requests beautifulsoup4
        
    - name: Fetch latest statistics
      run: |
        python fetch_statistics.py
        
    - name: Update README badges
      run: |
        python scripts/update_badges.py
        
    - name: Commit and push changes
      run: |
        git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
        git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
        git add .
        git diff --quiet && git diff --staged --quiet || (git commit -m "Update Gaza statistics - $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC')" && git push)
        
    - name: Create release if major update
      if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
      run: |
        # Create a release if manually triggered
        echo "Manual update completed"
```

## **Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **Update the workflow file** with the corrected version above
2. **Push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/update-stats.yml
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions permissions"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **If it still fails**, use the Personal Access Token method:
   - Create a PAT token
   - Add it to repository secrets as `PAT_TOKEN`
   - Use the second workflow version

## **Why This Happens:**

- GitHub Actions by default has limited permissions
- The workflow needs explicit `contents: write` permission
- The bot email should be `github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`

## **Test the Fix:**

After updating the workflow:
1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Click "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Update Gaza Statistics"
3. Monitor the execution to see if it succeeds

The workflow should now be able to commit and push changes automatically! üéâ
