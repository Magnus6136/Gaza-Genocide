## üö® Live Crisis Overview

**This is not a historical document. This is a live feed of human suffering happening in real-time.**

The Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million people, is experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. What began as a military operation has escalated into what international organizations are calling a **genocide in progress**. 

### **The Reality Right Now:**
- **Every 10 minutes**, a child dies from violence or starvation
- **Every hour**, entire families are wiped out
- **Every day**, hospitals are bombed while treating patients
- **Every week**, thousands more are displaced and left homeless

> ** These are not just numbers. These are human beings - children, mothers, fathers, grandparents - whose lives are being systematically destroyed.**
